    <!-- <p>IF YOU HAVE CRACKED THE MESSAGE JUST GO TO THE NEXT PAGE OF THE BOOK. </p> -->
    <p>IF YOU STOP, EVEN FOR A SECOND, TO THINK OF ALL THE THINGS YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IN LIFE, MAYBE YOU WILL ALSO REALIZE ALL THE CODES YOU'VE CRACKED. INSTEAD OF SEARCHING FOR THE ENDLESS MEANING, A MESSAGE COULD BE HIDDEN JUST UNDER YOUR NOSE.
      TO GO OUTSIDE, TO EXPLORE THE GREAT UNKNOWN, IT IS ALL PART OF A SEARCH FOR THE NEXT ADVENTURE. A LAST PAGE FULL OF IMAGES MIGHT BE WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF LIFE.</p>
