    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>This week’s assignment was to design an interactive high-fidelity version of the wireframes done in week 3. This should be a final version on the app’s visuals. After the prototype was done a colleague did an expert review on it.</p>

    <h2 id="prototype">Prototype</h2>
    <p>My final prototype followed the interface of the wireframing, with the main navigation being at “thumbs reach”. This time I used an actual map other than just leaving it blank, and also added more realism to other elements. The results are
      shown below:</p>
    <figure class="grid-left">
      <img src="images/week4digital1.png" onclick="openImage(this.src)">

      <figcaption>Search screen. (click to enlarge)</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="grid-right">
      <img src="images/week4digital2.png" onclick="openImage(this.src)">

      <figcaption>Routes screen. (click to enlarge)</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="grid-center">
      <img src="images/week4digital3.png" onclick="openImage(this.src)">
      <figcaption>Route detail screen. (click to enlarge)</figcaption>
    </figure>



    <p>Following feedback from my peers on last week’s assignment I changes the background from blue to white to improve readability. I also added the Tripp3r colors to the route options to make it more characteristic of the brand.</p>
    <p>Also, I used as example a trip using public transportation. For the sake of not cluttering the interface, the “bus” icon is used to select public transportation as a method. When the routes are displayed, icons for different types of public
      transportation (metro, tram…) are shown to clarify the user on what to do.</p>

    <h2 id="expert-review">Expert Review</h2>
    <p>I asked Alex to do an expert review on my current interface, and this is what he noted:<br>
      <b>Simple and natural dialogue:</b></p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>Going back to address input screen is not possible.</li>
      <ul class="article-list">
        <li>Solution: Add a back button or gesture.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Make things efficient</b></p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>Maybe having to select the route and then press the button takes too long.</li>
      <ul class="article-list">
        <li>Solution: Make the user select the route right away when he presses it.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Provide feedback</b></p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>What does ECO mean? No question mark is available, and the concept can be pretty broad.</li>
      <ul class="article-list">
        <li>Solution: Make a little popup whenever the user taps the eco button.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>


    <p><b>Be consistent and use standards</b></p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>The icon colors are only different from the route selection part on.</li>
      <ul class="article-list">
        <li>Solution: Implement the different colors throughout the entire app, or don’t use them at all.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>


    <p><b>Use visual hierarchy and keep it simple</b></p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>The blue route is hard to distinguish from the map colors.</li>
      <ul class="article-list">
        <li>Solution: Change either the map or the route color.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>There’s no clear divisor between the options tray to the map. Minimalistic, but visually complicated.</li>
      <ul class="article-list">
        <li>Solution: Improve color contrast.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Use emotion</b></p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>The interface doesn’t really communicate with the brands core values.</li>
      <ul class="article-list">
        <li>Solution: Maybe make the UI friendlier looking and implement the brand colors.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="review">Review Reflection</h2>
    <p>My colleague’s expert review was surprisingly helpful. I, again, overlooked the back button, and gained some insights on aspects of the interface I wouldn’t have found by myself.</p>
    <p>From my perspective, knowing why I put everything the way it is, I understand why an explanation to eco needs to be available. It could mean a lot of things from being zero emissions to using a bus that has an environmentally friendly engine.</p>
    <p>I also agree that I chose unorthodox colors. Maybe because of my color-blindness I see enough contrast, especially on route A’s blue shade against the map’s blue shade. I have figure out a way of displaying it all in a better way, probably by
      changing the maps color to a more traditional one.</p>



    <h2 id="process">Process & Tool Reflection</h2>
    <p>I continued working on Adobe Xd since it’s a familiar tool. I worked on the wireframes done last week, and it was a smooth process. This time I applied some more changes based on feedback I had received already. The result is a visually
      similar
      interface, with more polished items and an image of an actual map. To try an interactive version of the prototype, go to: <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff5c50;" href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/5ec87391-b968-49aa-64c6-df173bba9819-28f9/">BEP
        Assignment 2.2</a> <br><br>You can also view the prototype below. <b>Please note</b> that both here and on the link above the stroke widths are out of proportion because of Adobe Xd export settings.</p>
