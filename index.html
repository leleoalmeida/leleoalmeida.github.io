    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        I am a Brazilian product designer based in the Netherlands, currently working at <a
          href="https://www.hexaware.com/" target="_blank">Hexaware</a>. My work revolves around building
        <b>efficient</b>,
        <b>accessible</b>, and <b>flexible</b> design solutions that empower teams to create <b>better digital
          products</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through">My mom</span>
        My peers say I'm a passionate and empathic designer, captivated by
        education and accessibility in tech, always looking for ways to make digital experiences more inclusive. While I
        specialize in design systems and UX, I consider myself a problem-solver at heart, eager to tackle challenges big
        or small.
      </p>
      <p>
        Btw, as a full-time nerd, I'd love to talk about anything fantasy and
        sci-fi related ü§ñ <span style="color: var(--red-salsa);text-decoration: underline; cursor: default;"
          class="work">(I'm currently
          learning how to paint
          miniatures)</span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <h1>What do I know?</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        I'm quite knowledeable in design tokens, Figma components, web design, user research, design thinking, interface
        design, juggling three balls, prototyping, interaction design.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have good knowledge (and some professional experience) on web
        accessibility, Arduinos, video editing, knowing how volcanos are
        formed üåã, and UX writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowing how crucial the communication between designers and developers
        is, I try to keep in touch with the latest coding trends. And
        currently I'm learning how to build cool and interactive experiences on <a
          href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, as a UX Designer, Figma is like a second home to me, but I know pretty much every prototyping tool you
        throw at me. If you find me a new one, I'll treat you to some coffee.
        Go ahead, take the challenge üòâÔ∏è
